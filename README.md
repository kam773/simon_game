# The Project
A web replication of the classic game of memory - Simon! Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript using jQuery as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Curriculum.

After turning the game on and starting, users are displayed a sequence of tones and lights, with the game requiring the player to repeate the series to progress to the next level. Levels increase the sequence by one step each round, and the tempo with which the game displays the sequence increases halfway throught the game.
